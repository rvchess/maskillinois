        "Our goal as a student led organization is to help alleviate as many pain points during the pandemic as possible. People have found it hard to obtain masks, so through this app we hope to connect mask makers and mask needers to get masks to those who really need them."

    {
      question: "Why should I make masks for free ?",
      answer:
        "By signing up to be a donor, you are doing an incredible service that helps countless people and could even save lives. Additionally, you will be making masks directly for those in your community, so you will be able to see the direct impacts of your hard work."
    },
    {
      question: "Are masks really that effective ?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely! Although rhetoric was unclear and even contradictory at the beginning of the pandemic, multiple studies have now been done that prove and model how cases would sharply drop off if a great enough percentage of the population wears masks. Your mask prevents you from spreading the virus and other peoples’ masks prevent them from spreading the virus to you if they might have it."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I have to follow the videos exactly ? What if I have my own method for making masks ?",
      answer:
        "The videos we added are a great reference to get started with making masks, but they do not have to be followed exactly. However, you must follow the quality guidelines posted so there is a level of consistency. Feel free though to make your own designs and patterns, don’t be afraid to get creative!"
